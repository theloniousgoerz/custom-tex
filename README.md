This repository contains templates of latex files that I commonly use which I pre-formatted. 

## Materials 

The `Docs` folder contains sub-folders containing formatted templates that I use. 

The `CV` folder contains a blank template of my CV adapted from the excellent "Compact CV" template by Dario Taraborelli.
